                        Fast fashion and slow fashion retail websites are often visually distinct, but little research
                        has been done to analyze statistical differences in their structure and content.
                        As the conversation about the social and environmental impacts of fast fashion continues to
                        grow, the need for quantitative comparisons between fast & slow fashion also rises.
                        This research aims to collect quantitative data from the retail websites of five fast fashion
                        brands and five slow fashion brands in an effort to identify and analyze their differences.
                        I configured a web crawler for data collection, which is an automated program that can visit a
                        website, collect its content, and return this information for analysis.
                        The collected content includes hypertext markup language (HTML), which is the basic programming
                        language for creating web pages.
                        The crawler collected data on the websites of five fast fashion brands: Forever21, Shein,
                        Fashion Nova, H&M, and Pretty Little Thing, and five slow fashion brands: Big Bud Press, CHNGE,
                        Fashion Brand Company, Tunnel Vision, and iGirl.
                        This research presents the most significant results of my data collection and the resulting
                        statistical analysis of the fast and slow fashion brand comparison.
                        Overall, fast fashion brands took longer to crawl (~20 hours avg.) and had a larger number of
                        pages (10,000+).
                        It can be hard to understand the negative impacts that fast fashion has on our lives, but these
                        numbers help us quantify the overproduction and waste that comes from following trend cycles and
                        buying into fast fashion.
