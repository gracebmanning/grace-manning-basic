                        You're one of the most hardworking people I know! You also wake up the earliest of all my
                        friends and it's truly a sleep schedule I aspire to have. Thank you for turning me into a
                        morning person every time we make plans or hangout (so you basically fix my summer sleep
                        schedule).
                        <br><br>
                        There were a lot of times this past quarter where I kept saying "I need to call Emma and
                        tell
                        her about [...]" but then never did because I'm bad at doing those things sometimes. Even if
                        we
                        don't get to see each other often while I'm at school, it's nice to know you're just a phone
                        call away.
                        <br><br>
                        Also, I appreciate how much you've made an effort to visit me while I'm at school!! It is so
                        meaningful and I love having you visit! We've had some great times :)
                        <br><br>
                        There are lots of things I probably wouldn't have done if it weren't for you (example:
                        snorkeling and slowly getting over my fear of deep ocean water). You're consistently
                        suggesting
                        new things to do or try and I really appreciate having that extra push to do things I
                        wouldn't
                        think of doing. And even if I did think of them, it's nice to have a buddy to join me on
                        adventures. You're a great hiking, snorkeling, mini-golfing, bar-hopping adventure buddy :)
                        My
                        life would be way less interesting without you in it!

                        Anyways, here are some fun minigames for you to do. Enjoy!

                        The game we know and love, Wordle. You slay, I slay, we all slay. Here's a 6-letter Wordle game
                        based on a word you may hear people say to you sometimes... (don't get confused: it's not
                        slay-related, lol).<br>Hint: one letter repeats 3 times.

                        Of course, the minigames wouldn't be complete without a crossword puzzle. Good luck!
