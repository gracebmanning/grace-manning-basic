                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Grace Manning and I'm a 3rd-year student at UCI, majoring in Computer Science
                        and minoring in Film & Media Studies. Since my freshman year, I've been involved in a club
                        called Women in Information & Computer Sciences (WICS) at UCI. Being a part of WICS has changed
                        my college experience and has opened my eyes to the many opportunities available to me in the
                        tech & computer science world.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Each year, Anita B.org holds an event called the Grace Hopper Celebration, which is a week-long
                        conference dedicated to women in computing. For the past two years, Grace Hopper Celebration has
                        been offered virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic, hence the “v” in vGHC. I decided to attend
                        vGHC 2021 because I was really interested to see what it was like, especially after hearing lots
                        of great things about the event from my friends in WICS at UCI. This was my first time attending
                        GHC ever, so I came in with no expectations.
                        <br><br>
                        I had actually been traveling the week before vGHC began, so I felt like I was already behind in
                        my classes even though school had just started. For this reason, I took a less-involved approach
                        to vGHC so I could devote time throughout the week to catch up on classes. Thus, my main method
                        of participating in vGHC was via the Anita Borg On-Demand Studio. The plethora of videos
                        available in this on-demand library provided hours of content that I watched throughout the
                        week. I really loved this method of delivery because it allowed for more flexibility in my
                        schedule, which is one of the benefits of a virtual event!
                        <br><br>
                        As I perused the videos available online, I decided each day could have a theme. This type of
                        organization was a fun way to break up the content among different days. While all the videos
                        were great, this blog would be too long if I wrote about each one I watched. Therefore, I've
                        decided to write about my favorites that stuck out to me during the week.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Monday, Sept. 27 2021: Accessibility and Inclusivity</h3>
                    <p>
                        I spent today getting accustomed to Anita Borg On-Demand Studio. The first video that sparked my
                        interest was about accessibility, so I decided to pick that as the theme for the day. I made
                        myself a cup of coffee and got started!
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="nomargins">A11y Best Practices: How to Design, Build, and Test for Accessibility</h4>
                    <p>
                        I started with “A11y Best Practices: How to Design, Build, and Test for Accessibility” which
                        talked about “create accessible designs, configure accessibility testing workflows, and run
                        audits on your own website to ensure it is accessible.” The first thing I noticed when I started
                        the video was the presence of an ASL interpreter while the presenter spoke. I loved that the
                        creators of this video had the audience in mind, and made sure they used the same accessibility
                        techniques as were discussed throughout the presentation. I also learned a new term, a11y, which
                        is an abbreviation for <b>accessibility</b> because there are 11 letters between “a” and “y” in
                        that word.
                        <br><br>
                        The speakers were Katherine Lewis, a UX Engineer at LinkedIn, and Divya Manepalli, a Senior
                        Software Engineer at LinkedIn. Something I found interesting that Katherine spoke about was how
                        to create a website that can easily be read through a screen reader, such as using alt text to
                        ensure every non-text object has a text alternative. I also want to learn more about color
                        contrast, which is a property that can be improved to make websites more accessible for
                        low-vision audiences.
                        <br><br>
                        A great way to see if your website is accessible to blind or low-vision audiences is to test it
                        using a screen reader. This will let you know if the website makes sense when being read through
                        a screen reader, and is an important practice that I'd like to start using when creating
                        websites. Different screen readers are available depending on browsers and operating systems; I
                        would use one such as NVDA or JAWS, which are screen readers that are compatible with Chrome on
                        Windows systems. Divya, one of the presenters, showed a demo of a screen reader. It was
                        interesting to me that the screen reader will say out loud each letter that the user types,
                        unless the user is typing a password. This shows the importance of building a website properly
                        so the screen reader recognizes that the password is protected text rather than regular text.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I really enjoyed this presentation. I think it sparked my interest in learning more
                        about website accessibility and how I can improve my practices in the future to make websites
                        and applications more accessible.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="nomargins">A11y Best Practices: How to Design, Build, and Test for Accessibility</h4>
                    <p>
                        To continue with a theme of accessibility, I decided to watch “Creating an Accessible Virtual
                        World for Everyone” next. This presentation was given by Mariah Hart, a Technical Program
                        Manager on the AltspaceVR Team at Microsoft. Mariah opened her presentation with a verbal
                        description of herself, which is helpful to low-vision and blind audience members. What struck
                        me immediately was Mariah's statement that “differences are part of the human condition.” She
                        had adapted a quote from the World Health Organization by replacing the word “disability” with
                        “difference.” The reason for this, she explained, is so we can focus on the ability rather than
                        disabilities of people with differences.
                        <br><br>
                        Another really important point that Mariah discussed is that accessibility is not just a problem
                        for people with differences to worry about. Everyone should include accessibility in their
                        designs, products, and services. Personally, I want it to be something that I continuously
                        consider throughout my day.
                        <br><br>
                        In this presentation, I learned about the term <b>Extended Reality (XR)</b>. This refers to
                        technologies that “extend reality and merge the physical and virtual worlds,” as Mariah
                        explained. XR includes virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality. XR experiences can
                        allow people to overcome physical limitations. For example, someone with muscular dystrophy can
                        try out a surfing VR experience. There are currently some challenges to accessible XR
                        experiences, such as the money that is needed to purchase this equipment and pay for high-speed
                        internet.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, I found this to be yet another interesting and educational presentation. I enjoyed
                        Mariah Hart's discussion about the different possibilities that XR can provide to people with
                        differences, as well as the many factors that should be taken into consideration when designing
                        this type of technology!

                    <h3>Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2021: Learning New Concepts</h3>
                    <p>
                        After grabbing an iced matcha latte from Peet's to get my morning started, I sat down and
                        thought about my theme for the day. I noticed that there were lots of videos whose titles seemed
                        like completely new concepts to me. Thus, today I focused on watching presentations about things
                        I either didn't know much about or had never heard of before.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4 class="nomargins">Concentric Data Visualization Structures: A Novel Approach to Inspire New Data
                        Displays</h4>
                    <p>
                        The video that I started with today was about “concentric data visualization structures,” which
                        is a phrase I had never heard of before. The presentation was given by Jennifer Reiter, a Lead
                        Data Scientist at Target. As a data scientist, Jennifer works with data and has lots of
                        experience with creating visuals for a variety of audiences. She spoke about the benefits of
                        data visualization, including the science behind how our brains process visual information.
                        <br><br>
                        Due to a problem that her team needed to solve in regards to data visualization for business
                        partners, Jennifer created the concentric data visualization structures. This structure is a
                        system of rings that represent various data points. There are different ring types: percentage
                        rings, proportion rings, and count rings. Any combination of rings can be used to represent a
                        set of data with different properties in one visual.
                        <br><br>
                        Something I found incredibly useful during this presentation was Jennifer's breakdown of
                        Functional Programming vs. Object-Oriented Programming. Her codebase for the concentric data
                        visualization structure was originally written through a functional programming paradigm.
                        However, she eventually restructured her code to fit an object-oriented paradigm due to various
                        red flags in her code. This showed me the importance of re-evaluating code for potential
                        improvements. Overall, this was a really informative and neat presentation!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="nomargins">Compute-in-Memory: A New Approach to Machine Learning Accelerators and
                        Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                        The other video I wanted to highlight today is a presentation about machine learning from Rui
                        Li. I chose this video because I am completely unfamiliar with the technology behind machine
                        learning, and thought it'd be interesting to learn about new approaches to it. The presenter,
                        Rui Li, is a Hardware Engineer at SambaNova Systems.
                        <br><br>
                        To begin her presentation, Rui introduced the concept of compute-in-memory. She explained how
                        compute-in-memory leads to a type of computer architecture that is different from the typical
                        von Neumann structure. As the volume of data and information worldwide has significantly
                        increased over time, faster computing engines are becoming more important. The “communication
                        between memory and arithmetic unit,” as Rui states, is causing a bottleneck issue.
                        <br><br>
                        Rui's solution to this is to build a convolutional neural network in reRAM. This is a completely
                        new concept to me, so I didn't fully understand what was being discussed in the presentation.
                        However, this presentation opened my eyes to new possibilities in the machine learning industry
                        and showed me what types of things I could work on if I entered this field.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2021: Self Improvement & Empowerment</h3>
                    <p>
                        After fixing myself breakfast (water, orange juice, yogurt, & black berries), I scrolled through
                        the On-Demand Studio to determine what types of videos I should watch today. I saw a few
                        interesting ones that were related to self-improvement in regards to personal and professional
                        life. Since I haven't watched videos like these yet, I picked self-improvement and empowerment
                        as my theme for the day.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blogCaption">My breakfast and the first video of the day! (Sept. 29 2021)</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="nomargins">Dare to Solve “Impossible” Problems</h4>
                    <p>
                        I began by watching “Dare to Solve 'Impossible' Problems,” presented by Lisa Zane. Lisa is the
                        founder of Conscious Product Development, and has worked in kinesiology, journalism, product
                        development, project management, and more. One of the first things she pointed out in her
                        presentation is that people often start solving a problem before clearly defining what the
                        problem actually is. “Often, we are asking the wrong questions,” Lisa says. This leads to
                        solving the wrong problems and creating products that are unnecessary or slow us down.
                        <br><br>
                        Lisa spoke about 8 factors she believes are crucial to solving “impossible problems.” They are:
                        1) Find the problem, 2) Frame the problem, 3) Establish a unique shared vision, 4) Light the way
                        (provide the team with guidelines), 5) Create an environment where everyone can be themselves,
                        6) Build a team that sees the world from many different perspectives, 7) Have a clear and
                        transparent decision-making framework, and 8) Ignite a shared belief.
                        <br><br>
                        This presentation was largely focused on how to be a good leader of a team. I did not expect
                        that going in, but it was very interesting! I think these skills can be applied in a lot of
                        different ways, whether I'm a project manager or not. Overall, this presentation was delivered
                        in an interesting way and covers a crucial topic that I can definitely take with me throughout
                        my career. 10/10, would recommend!

                    <h4>REACT to Imposter Syndrome</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since it's recruiting season, with internship and job applications being a constant topic of
                        discussion, I figured I might benefit from a presentation about imposter syndrome. Everyone
                        needs a healthy reminder that “YOU BELONG!” every once in a while. Thus, I watched “REACT to
                        Imposter Syndrome,” a presentation by Prakriti Mateti, who is an Engineering Manager at Zendesk.
                        <br><br>
                        She spoke about the REACT acronym, which are steps to overcome imposter syndrome. Record
                        successful outcomes & feedback. Evaluate imposter thoughts & question assumptions. Ask trusted
                        people for opinions. Challenge assumptions using data from previous steps. Transform the
                        imposter thought and save it.
                        <br><br>
                        Something I found really important is Prakriti's note that we need to learn how to distinguish
                        between useful feedback and our own assumptions about our performance. Sometimes it is important
                        to question yourself and check to see if you have room to improve. However, this is different
                        from inaccurate and untrue imposter thoughts that don't help you improve in any way. Prakriti's
                        presentation was great and gave me some action items I can utilize next time I feel affected by
                        imposter syndrome!

                    <h3>Thursday, Sept. 30, 2021: Industry Insight</h3>
                    <p>
                        As I browsed through the Anita Borg On-Demand Studio for today's selection of videos, I realized
                        there were a lot that centered around experience and insight from the tech industry. Many
                        speakers were presenting about topics I had not considered to be part of a software engineering
                        role, so I settled on “Industry Insight” as today's topic.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="nomargins">Migration isn't just for the Birds: Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <p>
                        I began my fourth day of vGHC with a presentation about handling software migrations. Based on
                        the description, this seemed like a topic that is important to be familiar with as a software
                        engineer. The speaker of this presentation was Hava Babay-Adi, a Software Engineer and Technical
                        Lead at Google. She spoke about the importance of migration projects, which are “essential for
                        keeping your code clean and healthy, and your systems resilient and long-living.”
                        <br><br>
                        Migration projects are something I have not considered in the past. They often involve major
                        architecture changes, and it is important that they happen without compromising the current
                        system.
                        <br><br>
                        An example that Hava provided was a migration project she worked on in which a front-end
                        codebase was moved from GWT to the Angular framework. She spoke about the importance of
                        maintaining data correctness, efficiency, usability, and more. The program also needed to be
                        migrated while remaining live and undergoing continued use.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this was a very informative presentation. Hava provided lessons she learned from
                        software migration, along with the steps she recommends taking in migration projects. I learned
                        that migrations are an opportunity to re-evaluate code to bring in new value, and user testing
                        is always important!

                    <h4 class="nomargins">Baymax Dreams: Story and Design in Real-time</h4>
                    <p>
                        I selected this video about animation because I really loved Baymax in Big Hero 6… and I
                        couldn't resist a Disney presentation! The speakers were Jenn Burchfield, an Animation
                        Supervisor, and Megan Stifter, a Technical Art Director, both currently at Disney Television
                        Animation. They work on real-time animation technologies, and are working on interactive
                        storytelling. They spoke about bringing together artists and engineers to push the boundaries of
                        animation.
                        <br><br>
                        To overcome multiple challenges, Jenn and Megan described how their teams animate in a Game
                        Engine, which allows for prototyping and yields a collaborative environment. However, it creates
                        large binary files that have to be worked on simultaneously but can't have animators stepping on
                        each others' toes— they solved this issue using prefabs. Prefabs are containers for arbitrary
                        Game Object data.
                        <br><br>
                        This was an interesting topic to me because I love art, and I think it's important to consider
                        how we can merge art and technology to yield new and exciting creations. The need to animate in
                        real-time is a relatively new issue; as the animation tech industry grows, audiences can expect
                        to see faster rendering, interactive storytelling, and real-time animation to accompany these
                        changes.

                    <p>
                        Since it's the last day of vGHC, I thought I would check out the various Live Desk / Keynote
                        sessions available in the on-demand studio. They were all really interesting (no surprise
                        there), but I've decided to highlight two that I found to be especially useful for me!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="nomargins">From Techno-Optimism to Techno-Realism: What It Means to Innovate Responsibly
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I selected this presentation about responsible innovation because it's an important topic that
                        everyone should consider if they're going into a role in tech! The speaker was Margaret Gould
                        Stewart, the VP of Product Design & Responsible Innovation at Facebook.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Margaret's main point is that we need to consider challenges and things that could go wrong in
                        projects; this helps transition us from techno-optimism to techno-realism. These are crucial in
                        creating technology responsibly, and with the awareness that technology can massively impact
                        peoples' lives. Margaret's team at Facebook works with engineers in the early stages of product
                        design to ensure that their products have beneficial impacts, rather than contribute to societal
                        harm.
                        <br><br>
                        The steps that Margaret discussed, such as cultivating societal awareness, are things I'd like
                        to take with me as I go through my career and life. She also mentioned that technology may
                        unintentionally enforce societal norms that can be harmful. We should attempt to break societal
                        norms when designing technology in ways that work towards societal benefit. This is just one of
                        the many things I should take into consideration when creating or contributing to technology in
                        the future.

                    <h4 class="nomargins">Disability is an Opportunity for Innovation</h4>
                    <p>
                        A common theme throughout vGHC has been the impactful discussions surrounding technology's
                        intersection with disability and accessibility. I have really enjoyed these presentations, which
                        leads me to consider how my future career in tech can impact this conversation. I continued to
                        think about this as I watched “Disability is an Opportunity for Innovation,” a presentation
                        given by Haben Girma, a Human Rights Lawyer and Author. Haben Girma is deaf and blind, and she
                        began the presentation by sharing her personal experiences with her disabilities and assistive
                        technology.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the many ways that people with disabilities have innovated is through language. Language
                        can be verbal, visual, and tactile. Communication techniques have been innovated due to the need
                        for new types of communication. Haben spoke about how dance is also a form of communication,
                        because she can feel the beat of music and emotion in the movement when dancing.
                        <br><br>
                        What I found really important is that disabled people should not be the only ones working to
                        remove barriers. Non-disabled people need to work on removing barriers to accessibility because
                        it will benefit all of us when everyone has the same opportunities available! I would like to
                        take this lesson with me throughout my life and career.

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>
                        The virtual delivery of content at vGHC 2021 worked out well for me and my busy schedule. While
                        I did not participate in any live events, that's okay! I still learned a lot and I'm leaving
                        this experience feeling motivated to finish personal projects and work hard in my classes.
                        <br><br>
                        I think if I attended in-person GHC, I would love to attend live sessions and interact a lot
                        more with people. When it comes to virtual events, I tend to step back and do things on my own
                        time. Thus, I hope that GHC can be held in person for 2022!
                        <br><br>
                        One great aspect of this event was that the presentations I watched were held by speakers of big
                        and small companies. Some were from Google and Microsoft, while others were founders of their
                        own businesses that I hadn't heard of before. I am coming away with new knowledge of the
                        industry, plus new ideas about the job possibilities that are available to me! That is exactly
                        what I wanted when I decided to register for vGHC. This was a great experience and I'd recommend
                        it to any woman in tech!
