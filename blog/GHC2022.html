                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Grace Manning and I'm a 4th-year Computer Science major at UC Irvine. Since my
                        freshman year, I've been involved in a club called Women in Information & Computer Sciences
                        (WICS) at UCI, which has opened my eyes to the many opportunities available to me in the tech
                        industry.
                        <br><br>
                        Each year, Anita B.org holds an event called the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC), which is a
                        week-long conference dedicated to women in computing. To learn more, visit <a
                            href="https://ghc.anitab.org/about/" target="_blank">this website</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        This year, GHC was held in-person for the first time since the pandemic began. Since UCI is a
                        BRAID school, WICS members had the opportunity to attend GHC in-person or virtually through a
                        scholarship. I attended in-person GHC in Orlando, Florida with about 9 other WICS members, and
                        here's how it went…
                    </p>
                    <!-- TRAVELING DAY -->
                    <h3>Tuesday, September 20: Traveling to Orlando</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our travel day began at 5:30am, when the airport shuttles came to pick us up from UCI and take
                        us to the John Wayne Airport.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our plane boarded around 7am, and then we were off to Houston!
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        I managed to sleep on the plane, but woke up for a Stroopwafel and Coke. My go-to plane snacks!
                        <br><br>
                        When we landed in Houston, some of us had a strong craving for Subway (some of us = Alisa and
                        I). We spent almost 30 minutes walking around the different airport terminals in search of a
                        Subway that was supposedly nearby, according to Google Maps. Eventually, we gave up and had to
                        get sandwiches somewhere else.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After a nearly 4 hour layover, we boarded our flight to Orlando! I bought in-flight Wi-Fi to
                        catch up on all those GHC-related emails and prep for the upcoming week. We also got to enjoy a
                        beautiful sunset as we landed in Orlando, which I attempted to photograph from my aisle seat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After we finally landed and made it to our hotel, my roommate Jaedyn and I were moved to a
                        different hotel for the night due to overbooking. It made our travel day a bit longer, but we
                        eventually settled in around 10pm and got ready for an even bigger day ahead.
                    </p>

                    <!-- DAY 1 -->
                    <h3>Wednesday, September 21: GHC Day 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jaedyn and I left our hotel room at 6:50am to get checked in at our (actual) hotel and grab our
                        GHC badges. After leaving our bags at the hotel (and an unsuccessful attempt to check in), we
                        walked across the skybridge that was conveniently connected to the Orange County Convention
                        Center where GHC was held.
                        <br><br>
                        One thing I loved about Florida was the lush greenery all around us. While I personally did not
                        appreciate the 90% humidity, the plants sure did!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We checked in and got our GHC badges a bit too early…it was 8am and things typically didn’t
                        start until 9am. In this spare time, we explored the convention center and all it had to offer.
                        The conference spanned across the length of the convention center, which was full of natural
                        light! We also took a peek at the food court while it was still empty.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="nomargins">Exploring GHC</h4>
                    <p>
                        I didn't know this going into it, but my main focus of GHC became the Expo Hall. Open from 9am
                        to 5pm, this gigantic room held hundreds of company booths and representatives, and lots of
                        people trying to make connections that may lead to a job someday. I was one of those people!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img style="width: 70%" src="./blog-images/ghc22/wednesday/(6) 2022-09-21_expohall.jpg">
                    <p class="blogCaption">the Expo Hall</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I started by walking around to get an idea of what was around me. Almost immediately, I stumbled
                        upon the Snapchat booth and somehow got a fancy water bottle they were handing out.
                        <br><br>
                        It was quite a surprise to see the design of the booths; I might have been most impressed by
                        McDonald's display, which mimicked an in-store touchscreen kiosk experience.
                        <br><br>
                        My favorite part was having the opportunity to speak one-on-one with company representatives. It
                        was intimidating at first, since you have to walk into a booth space and approach someone (or
                        wait until someone is done with their conversation). I had wonderful conversations with
                        representatives from Nordstrom and Nike, which are both companies I would be grateful to work
                        at. I also got invited to a Nike party…more on that later!
                        <br><br>
                        I also had the opportunity to chat with a rep from Adobe (after waiting in line for about 10
                        minutes). She immediately opened my resumé and started giving me tips and ways to improve it. I
                        was taken aback at first, but it was actually great advice!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At 11am, I went to the Main Stage to watch a bit of the Opening Keynote. It started with a
                        speech from Brenda Darden Wilkerson, the President and CEO of AnitaB.org. Sitting in a room this
                        large, full of people clapping to an inspirational speech, was a very new experience for me.
                        It's very hard not to feel motivated while watching something like this.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blogCaption">Main Stage, viewing the Opening Keynote</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I left the keynote a bit early to try to check in at our hotel, but they didn’t have a room
                        ready for us yet. So…back to the Expo Hall!
                        <br><br>
                        I learned about a company called Arcadia, which creates software to help people lower their
                        energy bills and utilize clean energy. A few other companies I spoke with were Lululemon,
                        Starbucks, and Home Depot.
                        <br><br>
                        During my conversation about front-end development with the Home Depot representative, I asked
                        how frequently the topic of accessibility is discussed. She said it is actually a recurring
                        subject when they consider their website design, because the Home Depot logo colors (orange and
                        white) do not meet accessibility guidelines due to insufficient contrast between the text color
                        and background color. Low contrast colors can be difficult for low-vision people to read. This
                        was really interesting to me because it would require a complete rebrand to make their logo
                        actually accessible.
                        <br><br>
                        I also visited the Disney booth, which had a statue of Minnie Mouse, so I took a photo with her
                        (and Anushka & Jackie).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img style="width: 70%;" src="./blog-images/ghc22/wednesday/(10) 2022-09-21_disney.jpg">
                    <p class="blogCaption">a lovely photo of us with Minnie!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I tried to talk to a Disney representative about software engineering positions at Disney, but
                        she had a pretty limited knowledge about the hiring process and the different teams they have. I
                        left their booth feeling a bit unsatisfied, but decided I would go back the next day and try to
                        talk to someone else.
                        <br><br>
                        Since it was some time in the afternoon at this point, we all needed food. To the FOOD COURT! I
                        got a Nathan’s hot dog and some very expensive strawberry lemonade that definitely wasn’t worth
                        the price. You win some, you lose some. Anushka got a gyro, which is relevant because I’m
                        stealing her photo:

                    <p>
                        Later, Mia and I went to a discussion about how to adapt human-centered design to focus on
                        groups of users rather than individuals. My takeaway: when approaching a design, we may often
                        forget to envision a user as part of a group and how the design plays a role in that.
                        Human-centered design can be adapted to consider how a user’s individual role vs. group role
                        changes their interaction with the technology being considered.

                    <p>
                        For dinner, we went to Mia’s Italian Kitchen (it didn’t actually belong to our friend Mia
                        though). I ordered a Caesar salad and two plates of gnocchi, plus an Italian Spritzer to drink.
                        It was delish!

                    <h3>Thursday, September 22: GHC Day 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        I slept in until 9:30am this day (😲) and it was fantastic! I watched The Office and didn’t
                        leave the hotel room until 11am. The past two days of getting up very early and staying busy all
                        day long were starting to wear on me.
                        <br><br>
                        The previous day, I got a pack of free instant coffee at the Starbucks booth, so I made that
                        with the hotel coffee maker. To be honest…it tasted awful! Not sure if that was the fault of the
                        coffee or the hotel’s powder creamer. Anyways, I got dressed in my cute lil gingham number and
                        was ready to take on my 2nd day of GHC!
                    </p>

                        I spent some more time exploring the convention center. There was a meeting hall for 1:1s, which
                        are conversations with company representatives that are basically interviews. I didn’t sign up
                        for any since the slots filled up very quickly, but it seemed cool!

                    <p>
                        I ventured back into the Expo Hall to have a few more conversations. My goals were to speak to
                        representatives at Google and Disney, and it was successful! I had a great conversation with a
                        representative for Disney who told me about the many options they had for front-end developers,
                        since they have so many web and mobile app platforms.
                        <br><br>
                        Since I had lots of extra time, I also took the opportunity to take more pictures at the Expo
                        Hall. Snap Inc. also had a device with Snapchat open where you could pick filters to take photos
                        with. I also learned about the types of software engineering jobs at places like USAA and John
                        Deere. Did you know that tractors use machine learning to determine ideal seed placement over
                        time, and use cameras with computer vision that can distinguish between a crop and a weed for
                        pesticide application? I had no idea farming equipment was so high-tech.

                        and had explored enough of the conference. I wasn’t super interested in attending a discussion
                        and my eyes were tired of being open….so I decided to head back to the hotel for a nap.

                    <p>
                        After a wonderful nap in my hotel room, I got ready for something I was very excited about — the
                        Nike party! During my conversation with a Nike rep the previous day, I was handed a card with an
                        invite to their GHC afterparty…which felt super fancy and top-secret, even though it wasn’t.
                        <br><br>
                        I threw on my cute-but-casual outfit and nervously applied too many layers of deodorant before
                        Uber-ing to Disney Springs!
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Disney Springs is basically a mall, containing a few Disney-themed shops, but mainly chain
                        stores and boutiques. It also has a House of Blues, Planet Hollywood, and many restaurants, with
                        bodies of water linked throughout the area.

                    <p>
                        Most importantly, Disney Springs is home to Splitsville — a bowling alley / restaurant combo
                        that was also the location of the Nike party! Nike had the entire second floor rented out for
                        the party, and each person got free food and two free drink tickets (for the 21+ attendees).

                    <p>
                        When I arrived at the party, I met lots of new people from around the United States. I found a
                        group to bowl with, which comprised of 3 people from Vermont, 2 from the Orlando area, 1 from
                        Washington, D.C., and 1 from Los Angeles. We had a great time, and it turns out I’m awesome at
                        bowling! Some of us made sure to get in on the photo booth action…
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During the party, there was a raffle for Nike prizes (which I did not win), and then a dance
                        party in the center of the venue! I am proud to say I helped start the Cupid Shuffle on the
                        dance floor. There was also a conga line around the bar, which I observed but ultimately decided
                        not to join in. Too much work.
                        <br><br>
                        I also managed to have a conversation with a Nike rep at one point, which was a goal of mine
                        going into this. I approached a woman who had been running the raffle and asked her if she knew
                        any early talent recruiters. She said, “Follow me!”, and brought me around the party in search
                        of someone to talk to. Eventually, she located someone that could sit down and have a chat with
                        me. I found out that Nike has a program for new hires in which they get to sample 3 different
                        teams over a (9-month?) time period, and determine which team is best for them. Team-sampling
                        sounds like a cool way to figure out what you want to do at a company. It was an informative
                        conversation!
                        <br><br>
                        Also, it turns out I really like taking selfies. I took one while the party was going on, and
                        when everyone was leaving. Feast your eyes…

                        Then my cool new friends gave me a ride back to my hotel. When I got to my room, I found some
                        random people in there!! Just kidding — Anushka and Jackie were sitting on the floor and talking
                        to Jaedyn, who was just sitting in bed and looked like she could fall asleep at any second.
                    </p>

                        We hung out for about an hour, talking about our different nights (they had gone to a Google
                        party). They also watched me struggle to figure out how to pack up my suitcase. When Jaedyn
                        actually started falling asleep, Anushka and Jackie went back to their room and I went to bed.
                        It was a good night!

                        Friday…another big travel day. Our flight out of Orlando didn’t depart until 12pm, so I was able
                        to watch The Office in bed while I ate breakfast and had a bit of a slow morning.

                        We took Ubers to the airport, got through security, and took a little airport railway shuttle to

                        Our first flight was pretty quick, and we landed in Houston around 1pm local time, which many
                        would consider to be lunch time. As we journeyed to the gate for our next flight, I laid my eyes
                        upon something magical. It was the Subway that Alisa and I had spent 30 minutes searching for
                        last time we were here. WE FOUND IT! They were out of Italian Herbs & Cheese bread, and their
                        payment system was down so we could only use cash, but we got our sandwiches. And they tasted
                        like victory.

                        Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at GHC. I met great people, learned more about the job
                        opportunities available within the tech industry, and learned about myself and what I want to do
                        when I graduate. Seeing what companies I gravitated towards and what kind of keywords caught my
                        attention (i.e., web or app development) was useful in knowing what I should pursue further. I’m
                        grateful to have had the opportunity to attend GHC in person and explore everything this event
                        had to offer.
